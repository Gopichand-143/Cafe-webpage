# Cafe-webpage

I have created a STATIC WEB APP for hotel managment.
In this website people can check the menu and contact us by filling the features and they can see some of the features of our cafe .
I created this project using HTML, CSS and AZURE STATIC WEB APP service.
And I used the AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS for storing the code.
